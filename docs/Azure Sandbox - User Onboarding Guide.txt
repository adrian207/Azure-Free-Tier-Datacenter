Azure Sandbox - User Onboarding Guide
Document Version: 1.2 Date: October 17, 2025
Welcome to the Azure Development Sandbox!
This guide provides you with the essential information needed to access and start using the development environment.
1. How to Access the Environment
All access to the servers is managed through a secure web portal called Apache Guacamole. This allows you to get a remote desktop or terminal session directly in your browser.
* URL: Your system administrator will provide you with the web address.
* Credentials: You will also receive a unique username and password for the portal.
Once you log in, you will see a list of available server connections. Simply click on one to connect.
2. Your Environment Overview
The sandbox contains four primary servers for your use:
* vm-winweb-dev-westus2-001 (Windows Server):
   * Purpose: For hosting and testing Windows-based applications (e.g., IIS, .NET).
   * OS: Windows Server 2022
* vm-linuxproxy-dev-westus2-001 (Linux Proxy Server):
   * Purpose: Acts as a reverse proxy and entry point for web traffic.
   * OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* vm-linuxapp-dev-westus2-001 (Linux Application Server):
   * Purpose: For hosting and testing the backend of your Linux-based applications and services (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java).
   * OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* vm-bastion-dev-westus2-001 (Bastion Host):
   * Purpose: This is the secure gateway and is used for system administration. Direct access is limited.
3. Shared File Storage
A central file share is available to easily move files between the Windows and Linux servers.
* On the Windows Server: It is mapped as the Z: drive.
* On the Linux Servers: It is mounted at the /mnt/shared directory.
4. Important Rules & Guidelines
To ensure the environment remains stable and secure for everyone, please adhere to the following rules:
* Do Not Change Network Settings: Please do not alter any IP addresses, firewall rules (NSGs), or other network configurations.
* No Credentials in Code: Do not hard-code passwords or API keys. The system is configured to use Azure Key Vault for securely managing secrets. Ask your team lead for guidance.
* Report Issues: If you encounter any problems or suspect a security issue, please report it to the system administrator immediately.
